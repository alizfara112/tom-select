Welcome to the Tom Select bug tracker. Thank you for taking the time to
make Tom Select a better library!

Please keep in mind this repository has an important issue backlog and
that maintainers have limited time to fix issues, triage, and understand
them.

Place an `x` in the checklist steps (`[ ]` becomes `[x]`) to demonstrate
you have done/verified all the steps you needed to do.

Thank you for reading this! You can now erase everything up to the
following dashes, and then complete what's after.

* IGNORE THE ISSUE GUIDELINES
